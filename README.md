# React JS Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey of learning React JS. It contains a collection of projects and exercises, with each chapter focusing on a specific concept or feature.

## Chapters

This repository is structured into chapters, each as a self-contained project. To run any chapter, navigate to its directory, install the dependencies, and start the development server.

```bash
cd "Chapter-Directory-Name"
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

### 1st Chapter
A foundational project using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to set up a simple web page.

### 2nd Chapter
An introduction to React using the Vite build tool. This chapter covers the basic setup of a React application.

### 3rd Chapter
A continuation of the React basics, building upon the concepts from the previous chapter.

### 4th Chapter: `useContext`
This chapter explores state management in React using the `useContext` hook to share data across components without prop drilling.

### 5th Chapter: `useRef`
Focuses on the `useRef` hook, demonstrating how to access and manipulate DOM elements directly and manage values that persist between renders without causing re-renders.

### 6th Chapter: React Router
This chapter implements client-side routing using `react-router-dom`. It includes creating a multi-page application with a navigation bar, footer, and nested routes.

## Technologies Used

Across these projects, the following technologies are used:

-   **React**
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**
-   **Vite** as the build tool
-   **React Router DOM** for routing
-   **Tailwind CSS** for styling
